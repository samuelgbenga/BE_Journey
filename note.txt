Immediately Executing Function
You can execute a function immediately after you define it. Simply wrap the function in parentheses () and invoke it,
as shown in Listing 2-12.
Example:
(function foo() {
console.log('foo was executed!');
})();

There is the: Normal function
Immediate executing function
Anonymous function ( function without name Assigned to variable)
Higer-order function Functions that take functions as arguments are called higher-order functions.
