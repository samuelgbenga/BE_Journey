Beginning Node.js by Basarati Ali Syed ******** Date Dec 21/2022

Immediately Executing Function
You can execute a function immediately after you define it. Simply wrap the function in parentheses () and invoke it,
as shown in Listing 2-12.
Example:
(function foo() {
console.log('foo was executed!');
})();

There is the: Normal function
Immediate executing function
Anonymous function ( function without name Assigned to variable)
Higer-order function Functions that take functions as arguments are called higher-order functions.

Again Dec 27/2022 (i didnt do anything on the 26 "and i dont know why"
just finished :
		node_module still trying to wrap my head around it
		i understand node module as a folder system not a file system
		and also it as a differenct way of scanning from file system 
		file system uses some high level js programing shit to organis module
		meanwhile node_module just uses folder structer to scan.

	use rimraf to delete an js file localy or globaly on command line.
	underscore module (underscore.js function)
	like so:
	var _ = require('underscore');
	_.reject(arg1, arg2) or _.filter(arg1, arg2)
	.
	.
	optimist function used in place of process to collect all console arguments
	e.g process.argv replaced with
		require("optimist").argv
		
	you can use moment module to extensively manipulate date and time in nodejs
	in place of the inbuilt Date module

	json serialization means stringifying js object to json which is done by this function
	toJSON (if exist) or JSON.stringify(js object)
	
	__defineGetter__/__defineSetter__ to plug a function in way that it can be called like
	a metho. Sample code is:
	
	String.prototype.__defineGetter__('red', function (str) {
	// Changes the console foreground to red
	var redCode = '\x1b[31m';
	// Resets the console foreground
	var clearCode = '\x1b[39m';
	return redCode + this + clearCode;
	});
	console.log('Hello World!'.red);
	
	if red was a function it would have been called as red()

the difference between import and require: one is flexible the order is not (can be called anywhere)
					one allows dynamic import the other one does not (dont get)
