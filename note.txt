Beginning Node.js by Basarati Ali Syed ******** Date Dec 21/2022

Immediately Executing Function
You can execute a function immediately after you define it. Simply wrap the function in parentheses () and invoke it,
as shown in Listing 2-12.
Example:
(function foo() {
console.log('foo was executed!');
})();

There is the: Normal function
Immediate executing function
Anonymous function ( function without name Assigned to variable)
Higer-order function Functions that take functions as arguments are called higher-order functions.

Again Dec 27/2022 (i didnt do anything on the 26 "and i dont know why"
just finished :
		node_module still trying to wrap my head around it
		i understand node module as a folder system not a file system
		and also it as a differenct way of scanning from file system 
		file system uses some high level js programing shit to organis module
		meanwhile node_module just uses folder structer to scan.
