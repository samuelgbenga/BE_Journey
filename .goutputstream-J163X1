This is my backend journy indeed:
Hard work. Every Night
Begin on December 10/2022
..
what to do today 10/2022
Focus on Basical preparation
1. Download just code editor vs code
2. signup for free BE courses online if available
3. Download recommended materials: Book list to download
	https://www.turing.com/kb/top-nodejs-books-for-developers
4. Build a little backend project using videos set up your vs code along side..
5. Ten backend app for beginners using Node.js
	https://codersera.com/blog/nodejs-projects-for-beginners/
6. Join Nodejs meetings/group/clan
	https://nodejs.org/en/get-involved/
	https://github.com/nodejs/community-committee

	MonogDB password: kV2@eSTjRMw@jfA
	
******************************************
Today 14 dec 2022
browse articles: mongoos session explained
****************************************
Dec 15 2022
browse articles on:
	mongoose session explained
	study node js: watch videos and read pdf
	

#Backe to my senses Dec 21/2022......
-------plan the next project:
	-- Read/study for the next project
	-- prepare schema for the project


***************************************
#Back from nonsense. Dec 23/2022
	sleeping is not part of my schedule
	do not see sleeping as an option.
	you only sleep abruptly, momentarily inbetween work, study or coding. not trading though
	
Next project*****************
work with mongodb offline**************'
read books on mongodb
locally host backend with mongodb: link to part two of the video
	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wry-Mb2auSo

********************************************************
completed the previous todo fullstack app
starting a blog page fulstack app right away.
link from mongodb:
	mongodb+srv://samuelgbenga:<password>@cluster0.cpdc2he.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority
	
******************************************************************
Am back again i have rescheduled my software development time to 12 hrs a day so yeah.

************************************************************
welcome back again after somedays i skipped yesterd for no good reason 
This is January 3/2023: God help us
use mem.dev to memorise hard/complicated shunk of code
***********************************************
this is january 5 but i did do something on the fourth just didnt update this writing
- i crashed the project with audit fix that was suppose to fix the warning etcetera.
********************************
i have been thinking on how to go about my learning and the learning curve etcetera.
so this is it.
i will practice with three different videos on MERN stack complete basic app though.
i will repeat each 3 times and the 4th time for pleasure or torment of the flesh.
and then my next two step will be:
				1 to complete every project on freecode camp
					from 1 basic html css frontend
					to javascript algorithm
					to react project building scoring nothing less than 100%

				2 step two:
				the next step will be to apply for lighter frontend or backend like freecodecamp certificates if not available (that is after a thorough search) then you build.
				10 major project starting with 
				movie review app like IMDB (God help you: Good luck)
				
				

 // "start": "react-scripts start",
    // "build": "react-scripts build",
    an error encountered the image refused to display on my path will solve that on the second
    phase of building
******************************************
back again with another strategy: you know my strategies are evolving and better to make 
programming easier sweeter and better for me as i advance further or delve deeper.
The NEW STRATEGY IS:
		-focus on small time videos 1hr to 1hr-30 mins
		- first:-do just raw coding along at first
		- second:- go throught the code understanding everycomponent 
			:sub_second steps:-
					- Map out and memorize the general structure the
					(the connection between each top level component)
					- delve into each component:- and repeat thesame process
					for each.
		- code thesame thing all by yourself using only google as resource

		
-for my backend project: i have just three projects to practice on:
	-then i complete project memory by myself (just go through is code base and study the
							different components used)
	- you can also watch the video without coding just ones (complete one's)
	

*******************************************************
after that i go back to freecodecamp (complete js project, html&css, react project again and fair ) cert and other cert.

--finally my own big project.
********************
date is 12 january 2023:
still inspecting the blog_api code:
after that i start building mine from scratch
